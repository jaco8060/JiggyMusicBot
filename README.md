## Raspberry Pi Implementation

This implementation is designed for a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W using DietPi as the operating system.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with DietPi

1. Visit the official [DietPi Installation Guide](https://dietpi.com/docs/install/) and follow the instructions for Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
2. Download the appropriate DietPi image for Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
3. Flash the image to your microSD card using a tool like Etcher or Raspberry Pi Imager.
4. Insert the microSD card into your Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and power it on.
5. Follow the initial setup process for DietPi, ensuring you connect to your network.

### Step 2: Install Docker and Git on DietPi

1. After setting up DietPi, SSH into your Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
2. Visit the [DietPi Software Installation Tool guide](https://dietpi.com/docs/dietpi_tools/software_installation/) for detailed instructions on installing software packages.
3. To install Docker and Git, use the following commands in the DietPi-Software tool:
   ```
   Docker
   Git
   ```
   This will install Docker, Git, and all their dependencies.

4. After installation, reboot your Raspberry Pi:
   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```

### Step 3: Clone the Repository and Set Up the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jaco8060/JiggyMusicBot.git
   cd JiggyMusicBot
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project directory:
   ```
   nano .env
   ```

3. Add your environment variables to the `.env` file:
   ```
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<your-discord-bot-token>
   YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<your-youtube-api-key>
   ```

### Step 4: Build and Run the Docker Container

Create a bash script named `start_bot.sh` in the project directory:

```bash
nano start_bot.sh
```

Add the following content to the script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t jiggybot1 .

# Stop the existing container if running
docker stop jiggyBotContainer1

# Remove the existing container
docker rm jiggyBotContainer1

# Run a new container with the built image
docker run -d --name jiggyBotContainer1 --env-file .env --restart unless-stopped jiggybot1
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x start_bot.sh
```

Run the script to build and start the bot:

```bash
./start_bot.sh
```
